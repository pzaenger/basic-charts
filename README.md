# basic-charts

This project is intended for learning purposes only and should not be used in any productive environment. However, it can be used to transform predefined Vega specifications to data URI scheme (here: data URL), SVG or HTML (though it might be easier to use Vega directly).

The project itself is written in [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) and uses mainly:

* [Vega](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vega)
* [Vega-Embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vega-embed)
* [Typedoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typedoc)
* [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)
